## <a name="overview">Overview</a>

`{xmpdf}` provides functions for getting and setting pdf [documentation info](https://opensource.adobe.com/dc-acrobat-sdk-docs/library/pdfmark/pdfmark_Basic.html#document-info-dictionary-docinfo) entries and [bookmarks](https://opensource.adobe.com/dc-acrobat-sdk-docs/library/pdfmark/pdfmark_Basic.html#bookmarks-out).

In the future we plan to add support for getting/setting Extensible Metadata Platform (XMP) for a variety of media formats with a particular interest in setting Creative Commons license metadata.

## <a name="installation">Installation</a>

```{r install, eval = FALSE}

Depending on what you'd like to do you'll need to install some additional R packages and/or command-line tools:

* **[{qpdf}](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/qpdf/index.html)** can be used to get the number of pages in a pdf.  Note currently a dependency of [{pdftools}](https://docs.ropensci.org/pdftools/).

  + `install.packages("qpdf")`

* **[{pdftools}](https://docs.ropensci.org/pdftools/)** can be used to get documentation info entries.
  Note currently depends on [{qpdf}](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/qpdf/index.html).

  + `install.packages("pdftools")` will probably install {qpdf} as well

* **[exiftool](https://exiftool.org/)** can be used to get number of pages in a pdf.

  + `sudo apt-get install libimage-exiftool-perl` (Debian/Ubuntu)

* **[ghostscript](https://www.ghostscript.com/)** can be used to set pdf bookmarks and documentation info entries. Can also be used to get the number of pages in a pdf.

  + `sudo apt-get install ghostscript` (Debian/Ubuntu)

* **[pdftk](https://www.pdflabs.com/tools/pdftk-the-pdf-toolkit/)** or **[pdftk-java](https://gitlab.com/pdftk-java/pdftk)** can be used to get/set pdf bookmarks and documentation info entries.  Can also be used to get the number of pages in a pdf.
