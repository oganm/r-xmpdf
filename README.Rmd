## <a name="overview">Overview</a>

`{xmpdf}` provides functions for getting and setting [Extensibe Metadata Platform (XMP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensible_Metadata_Platform) metadata in a variety of media file formats as well as getting and setting PDF [documentation info](https://opensource.adobe.com/dc-acrobat-sdk-docs/library/pdfmark/pdfmark_Basic.html#document-info-dictionary-docinfo) entries and [bookmarks](https://opensource.adobe.com/dc-acrobat-sdk-docs/library/pdfmark/pdfmark_Basic.html#bookmarks-out) (aka outline aka table of contents).

## <a name="installation">Installation</a>

```{r install, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("trevorld/r-xmpdf")
```

Depending on what you'd like to do you'll need to install some additional R packages and/or command-line tools:

* **[{qpdf}](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/qpdf/index.html)** can be used to get the number of pages in a pdf.  Note currently a dependency of [{pdftools}](https://docs.ropensci.org/pdftools/).

  + `install.packages("qpdf")`

* **[{pdftools}](https://docs.ropensci.org/pdftools/)** can be used to get documentation info entries in pdf files.
  Note currently depends on [{qpdf}](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/qpdf/index.html).

  + `install.packages("pdftools")` will probably install `{qpdf}` as well

* **[exiftool](https://exiftool.org/)** can be used to get/set xmp metadata in a variety of media files as well as documentation info entries in pdf files.  Can also be used to get the number of pages in a pdf.  Note can be installed by [{exiftoolr}](https://github.com/JoshOBrien/exiftoolr).

  + `install.packages("exiftoolr"); exiftoolr::install_exiftool()` (Cross-Platform) 
  + `sudo apt-get install libimage-exiftool-perl` (Debian/Ubuntu)
  + `brew install exiftool` (Homebrew)
  + `choco install exiftool` (Chocolately)

* **[ghostscript](https://www.ghostscript.com/)** can be used to set bookmarks and documentation info entries in pdf files. Can also be used to get the number of pages in a pdf.

  + `sudo apt-get install ghostscript` (Debian/Ubuntu)
  + `brew install ghostscript` (Homebrew)
  + `choco install ghostscript` (Chocolately)

* **[pdftk-java](https://gitlab.com/pdftk-java/pdftk)** or perhaps **[pdftk](https://www.pdflabs.com/tools/pdftk-the-pdf-toolkit/)** can be used to get/set bookmarks and documentation info entries in pdf files.  Can also be used to get the number of pages in a pdf.

  + `sudo apt-get install pdftk-java` (Debian/Ubuntu)
  + `brew install pdftk-java` (Homebrew)
  + `choco install pdftk-java` (Chocolately)

## <a name="examples">Examples</a>

A simple example where we create a two page pdf using `pdf()` and then add XMP metadata, PDF documentation info metadata, and PDF bookmarks to it:

```{r basic}
library("grid")
library("xmpdf")

# Create a two page pdf
f <- tempfile(fileext = ".pdf")
pdf(f, onefile = TRUE)
grid.text("Page 1")
grid.newpage()
grid.text("Page 2")
invisible(dev.off())

# Edit XMP metadata
print(get_xmp(f)[[1]])
x <- xmp(title = "Two Boring Pages", creator = "John Doe")
set_xmp(x, f)
print(get_xmp(f)[[1]])

# Edit PDF documentation info
print(get_docinfo(f)[[1]])
d <- docinfo(author = "John Doe",
             title = "Two Boring Pages",
             keywords = c("R", "xmpdf"),
             filename = f)
set_docinfo(d, f)
print(get_docinfo(f)[[1]])

# Edit PDF bookmarks
print(get_bookmarks(f)[[1]])
bookmarks <- data.frame(title = c("Page 1", "Page 2"), page = c(1, 2))
set_bookmarks(bookmarks, f)
print(get_bookmarks(f)[[1]])

unlink(f)
```

## <a name="comparison">Limitations by backend</a>

`{xmpdf}` feature | `exiftool` | `pdftk` | `ghostscript`
---|---|---|---|
Get XMP metadata | **Yes** | **No** | **No**
Set XMP metadata | **Yes** | **No** | **Poor**: when documentation info metadata is set then as a side effect it seems the documentation info metadata will also be set as XMP metadata
Get PDF bookmarks | **No** | **Okay**: can only get Title, Page number, and Level | **No**
Set PDF bookmarks | **No** | **Okay**: can only set Title, Page number, and Level | **Good**: supports most bookmarks features including color and style but only action supported is to view a particular page
Get PDF documentation info | **Yes** | **Yes** | **No**
Set PDF documentation info | **Yes** | **Yes** | **Yes**: as a side effect when documentation info metadata is set then it seems will also be set as XMP metadata

Known limitations:

* `get_bookmarks_pdftk()` doesn't report information about bookmarks color, style, and whether the bookmarks
  should start open or closed.
* `set_bookmarks_gs()` supports most bookmarks features including color and style but only action supported is to view a particular page.
* `set_bookmarks_pdftk()` only supports setting the title, page number, and level of bookmarks.
* All of the `set_docinfo()` methods currently do not support arbitrary info dictionary entries.
* Datetimes are often converted to UTC time (any original "UTF offsets" may not be preserved).
* As a side effect `set_docinfo_gs()` seems to also update any matching XPN metadata
  while `set_docinfo_exiftool()` and `set_docinfo_pdftk()` don't update
  any previously set matching XPN metadata.
  Some pdf viewers will preferentially use the previously set document title from XPN metadata
  if it exists instead of using the title set in documentation info dictionary entry.
  Consider also manually setting this XPN metadata using `set_xmp()` 
* Old metadata information is usually not deleted from the files by these 
  operations (i.e. these operations are often theoretically reversible).
  If deleting the old metadata is important one may want to consider calling
  `qpdf::pdf_compress(input, linearize = TRUE)` at the end.
